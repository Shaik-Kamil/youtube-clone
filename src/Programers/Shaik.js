          Iâ€™m currently a FullStack web Development Fellow at Pursuit which is
          an intensive 12 month FullStack web development fellowship where I am
          upskilling/ reskilling to break into tech. I have always been the
          person who loves solving complex problems and breaking them down.
          Since I have always been an avid lifelong learner, Software
          Engineering felt like the next natural and logical step career-wise.

        <p style={{ color: 'darkblue' }}>
          Prior to this, I have experiences in various roles all in one way or
          another that involve Operations Management, whether its my recent
          experience as a warehouse operations lead where I was in charge of
          both day to day operations as well as personnel management. I have
          worn many hats in this role such as customer service support, vendor
          management, delivery partners management and logistics management
          among many others. Looking back on my past work experiences, I have
          demonstrated an agile and quick adaptability to new roles and
          industries while successfully exceeding expectations.
